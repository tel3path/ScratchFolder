/**
* "Conventional code generation:

* "This code will not receive the benefits of CHERI memory protection 
* "â€“ although it may execute encapsulated within sandboxes maintained
* "by CHERI-aware code, and thus can participate in a larger 
* "compartmentalized application. It will also be able to call hybrid
* code." - UCAM-CL-TR-951, Section 2.4.6
*
* This vanilla version should contain only CHERI-unaware code.
* [Attempt to] 1) compile and 2) run three ways:
* - using clang locally (Apple clang version 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)
* Target: x86_64-apple-darwin20.6.0
* Thread model: posix
* OS: macOS Big Sur v11.7.1)
* - using g++ remotely in a non-CHERI environment on FreeBSD
* - using QEMU morello-purecap on bencher14
* Two other companion files adapted for similar comparison:
* fakedb_cherienv.c and fakedb_morello.c respectively
*
* Start with primitive data types and iterate from there.
