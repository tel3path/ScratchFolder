/**
* "Conventional code generation:
* "Unmodified operating systems, user programs, and user libraries 
* "will work without modification on CHERI processors. 
* "This code will not receive the benefits of CHERI memory protection 
* "â€“ although it may execute encapsulated within sandboxes maintained
* "by CHERI-aware code, and thus can participate in a larger 
* "compartmentalized application. It will also be able to call hybrid
* code." - UCAM-CL-TR-951, Section 2.4.6
*
* This begins as a straight copy of the vanilla version,
* contain only CHERI-unaware code.
* Then I attempt to 1) compile and 2) run it using g++
* remotely in a non-CHERI environment on FreeBSD
* and make changes as necessary.
* [Attempt to] 1) compile and 2) run three ways:
* - The vanilla version, fakedb_vanilla.c, was compiled and
* run using clang locally (Apple clang version 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)
* Target: x86_64-apple-darwin20.6.0
* Thread model: posix
* OS: macOS Big Sur v11.7.1)
* - This version built using g++ remotely in a non-CHERI environment on FreeBSD
* - Fakedb_morello.c built using QEMU morello-purecap on bencher14
*
* Start with primitive data types and increment
